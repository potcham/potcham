### Hi there 👋
Huge interest in deep learning and robotics 🤖. I mainly work in 😎**computer vision**😎 topics but I am getting into audio & NLP.

🔭 I’m currently collaborating on specific projects:
  * extracting tag from P&ID files (construction industry)
  * body pose estimation

⚡ Fun fact: Even though, I created my github account a couple years ago, I used to not publish anything. So, It's like a fresh start🤔
